# Care Consult

## MVP
- Scheduling functionality (Calendly-like solution)
- Landing page with options: 
  - Volunteer time
  - Schedule an appointment
- Seed list of providers? Can start with NYC medical board website and scrape Dr list? 

## Other Features
- Video chat functionality? Maybe it only needs audio for POC. Could use Jitsi 
- Ability for providers to initiate verification process
- Would need to hook into various state medical board DBs in the US
- Ability for platform to take into account license expiration date
- Add other types of certified health professionals? Psychologists etc.
