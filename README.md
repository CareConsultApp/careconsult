# Care Consult

## MVP
- Scheduling functionality (Calendly-like solution)
- Landing page with options: 
  - Volunteer time
  - Schedule an appointment
- Seed list of providers? Can start with NYC medical board website and scrape Dr list? 

## Other Features
- Video chat functionality? Maybe it only needs audio for POC. Could use Jitsi 
- Ability for providers to initiate verification process
- Would need to hook into various state medical board DBs in the US
- Ability for platform to take into account license expiration date
- Add other types of certified health professionals? Psychologists etc. 




# Used Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b654c94e-08a6-4b79-b443-7837581b1d8d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms-ci/deploys)

**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).

This repo contains an example business website that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
