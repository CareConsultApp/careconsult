## Why CareConsult
The Covid-19 pandemic is straining healthcare systems around the globe. CareConsult was created to connect licensed volunteer health professionals with patients at home to reduce the burden on hospitals and clinics.

The project is actively soliciting contributors.

## MVP
- Scheduling functionality (Calendly-like solution)
- Landing page with options: 
  - Volunteer time
  - Schedule an appointment

## Other Features
- Video chat functionality? Maybe it only needs audio for POC. Could use Jitsi 
- Ability for providers to initiate verification process
- Would need to hook into various state medical board DBs in the US
- Ability for platform to take into account license expiration date
- Add other types of certified health professionals? Psychologists etc. 
- Seed list of providers? Can start with NYC medical board website and scrape Dr list?
